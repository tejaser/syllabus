## 1. Introduction

Acquire a new skill is something **hard**, that requires a lot of **discipline**, **willpower** and a **good orientation**. 

When the subject to be learned is very dynamic, this task becomes exponentially more complex. For that reason, we created the **JavaScript Society**. This is a group for **everyone** that want to thoroughly **dominate** the JavaScript language, using it to create complex and scalable applications.

## 2. Justification

> "99 out of 100 JavaScript developers I interview lack the skills required to hit the ground running on a scalable production JavaScript application."
>
> — [Eric Elliot](https://twitter.com/_ericelliott)

There are **thousands** of resources about JavaScript on the internet, and you sooner or later will fall in the *paradox of choice*, situation that in the best case will make you paralyzed without know what to do.

Furthermore, be able to keep yourself continuously surpassing your limits is something really hard, because you will inevitably achieve a plateau and stay stagnant, without evolving and sharpen your skills.

In order to overcome these challenges, we need several different approaches, and this is what our project will offer to you!
